  - an awesome project Indian targeting retail sector,
  - the next big thing in livestreaming,
  - a new way to show ads,
  - and few other things I can't recall at the moment...
- 🌱 <strike>Currently learning recoiljs</strike> Postponed as it does not support persistance out of the box, yet. So back to redux. Figuring out best approach towards testing react apps.
