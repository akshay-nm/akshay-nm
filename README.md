### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...

Friends know me as UX-Pirate, because I have a knack for figuring out the easiest way to expose a feature!  

I like problems which force me to think and push me beyond what I already know. 🤓  
But it's also good to know things ones a while... 😎

I am a T-shaped developer with in-depth know-how of the React way of doing stuff. 

I like keeping'em lean, to the point, and simple. 
Have templates for everything related to web-applications. 
So if you are in the market for some rapid prototyping, I'm your man... 🏋️‍♂️
