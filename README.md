Friends know me as UX-Pirate, because I have a knack for figuring out the easiest way to expose a feature!  

I am an expeirenced MERN stack developer, ditching React and shifting towards Svelte.

I like keeping'em lean, to the point, and simple. 
Have templates for everything related to web-applications. 
So if you are in the market for some rapid prototyping, I'm your man... 🏋️‍
I also try to give back to the community whenever I can. Here's my stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/users/5712125/akshay-kumar
