### Hi there 👋

<!--
**akshay-nm/akshay-nm** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->
I am a T-shaped developer with in-depth know-how of the React way of doing stuff.
- 🔭 Currently working on 
  - an awesome project Indian targeting retail sector,
  - the next big thing in livestreaming,
  - a new way to show ads,
  - and few other things I can't recall at the moment...
- 🌱 <strike>Currently learning recoiljs</strike> Postponed as it does not support persistance out of the box, yet. So back to redux. Figuring out best approach towards testing react apps.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on anything js, python, or game-dev
- 💬 Ask me about things you can't lookup on google.
- 📫 How to reach me: akshay.kumar@sdiot.io
